if the data has shape (x, y, z) then it seem that the x is the z axis shown in k3d.
the y seems to be the y axis on k3d.
the z is the x-axis on k3d.

When adding the Sun positions as (x, y, z) and comparing it in k3d;
	-the x is the x-axis
	-the y is the y-axis
	-the z is the z-axis.

When setting the camera position as (x, y, z) and comparing it with k3d:
	-the x is the x-axis.
	-the y is the y-axis.
	-the z is the z-axis.

When setting the camera reference as (x, y, z) and comparing it with k3d:
	-the x is the x-axis.
	-the y is the y-axis.
	-the z is the z-axis.

When setting the up vector as (x, y, z) and comparing it with k3d:
	-the x is the x-axis.
	-the y is the y-axis.
	-the z is the z-axis.
